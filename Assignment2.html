            <h2>The reading starts of talking about the great amount of information that is being shared online. Suggesting having such a great amount of new information, can cause individuals to not comprehend or remember what they learn or read online that well. </h2>
            <h3> It also talks about the positives of technology, saying many things that are useful are improving more and more everyday. Like microphotography, trying to get the microphotography to examine what it captures through projection instead of directly. The reading takes into account the price of compressing material into one space, saying a microfilm would cost around 10 cents, and eventually go down if it continues to stay in a microfilm.</h3>
            <h4> I found the digital technology of the “voder” to be very interesting, it was able to produce sound with vibrations, having no real human voices in it. It made me think about how advanced technology has become. Technology is rapidly improving  its ability to store more and more data, which it uses to have almost a “brain like” feature in a technological device. Soon devices will be able to select their own data, which adds to devices becoming more smart, and human like. The way data is stored in devices however is more organized than the human brain, having things like files in alphabetical order for example, relying more and more on the data storage and organization of technology, the reading compares the human brain to devices. </h4>
