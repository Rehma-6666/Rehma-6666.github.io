    that is being provided. For example, there could be non-serious information presented in a serious manner or platform, that would trick peoples minds into believing it is something more serious. An example could also be singing, a singer Could
sing a happy song in a sad tone, creating sad emotions for the audience, Lana del rey could. Overall platforms should be the main focus, if the platform does not go with the theme then the information will not be taken seriously.</p></font>
