  <h1>In this reading I liked learning about digital arts, and how it became popular for many artists
    .The reading interviewd many artists about their technical experience. One artist that stood out to me was
    EO, mother/child, an artist who was inspired to 3D scan an artwork after watching her niece and son sleeping 
    in the car. It was a precious moment for the artist and she was able to express that memory through 3d scanning. 
    She also wants to continue working on it with digital materiality. Which goes to show there is no limit to creativity
    as she can continue adding to her already abstract piece of art. This work also inspired me because you do not need to think
    of something out of this world creative to come up with unique arrtwork, having a simple concept, like the artist did or even something
    of interest to you can be enough for digital art, as so many aspects in digital art allow you to add a creative aspect to simple ideas.</h1>
