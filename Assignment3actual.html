                With the camera the world changed, capturing things the human eye was unable to see. Capturing “movement” and moments never captured before. It helped create a new perspective of the world. The camera allowed multiple sizes of things, like paintings. Images or paintings were able to spread more fastly because of the camera. Giving people the chance to view admirable things without traveling to see them. Before the invention of the camera, certain images had more meaning or power to them, like the Icon, where the image was located had a specialty to it. Until the camera allowed it to be seen everywhere not leaving the special effect of its original origin.

                Berger talks about nudity in paintings. He uses different paintings to make his point clear on whether or not women the paintings are made nude for the viewer, or if it is to create a painting to showcase the woman's confidence. In some paintings, the women are given facial expressions that are appealing to viewers. However, these paintings usually symbolize a sense of falseness as the women do not really feel that way, it is simply for the viewer's pleasure. The women who have a facial expression for example, of surprise, is a form of true art because it captures how a woman really feels or gets caught off guard when seeing her true self or knows when she is being seen.

                Berger talks about the value of oil paintings. He comments on the materialism of society, and how oil paintings are simply works done on a canvas, but the prices are marked incredibly high, for some famous artists they are in the millions. In one of the oil paintings the artist has painted materials or “possession” of materials, however, Berger explains those materials in the painting, are simply painted. Those materials no longer exist in real life, so why are the prices so high? Could the prices be so high, because of the artist who paints them, or to simply have an original peace, that few can afford? In one painting Rembrand an artist paints possession of materials, he showcases money and power in the painting, yet later showcases how he is no longer able to afford those pieces, hinting at how the value of oil paintings is too high. The oil painting became such a powerful thing to own because it fed into the world of materialism, artists started painting possession of things in their paintings, being able to add a lot of details to the materials with the oil paints.

                Berger discusses publicity images and oil paintings. Claiming publicity images are a stunt to convince people to buy things, kind of like advertisements. However, oil paintings are things that people usually paint about things or materials they already own, they paint the oil paintings in detail of the materials. Publicity images often go around making people who own them feel inferior to those who don’t, pressuring many people into buying them. Berger says publicity images are a way to feed into peoples desires, or insecurities, if an advertisement showcases productct about clear skin, and shows a before and after, the viewer will become insecure if they are the before, or do not have the same skin as shown in the advertisement, so they will want to purchase the product. Todays technology plays a role into making these products look more enhanced aswell.
